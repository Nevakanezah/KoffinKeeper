==========================
Gee Bill, I sure love the 'Coffin Makers' card from Leder Games'
'Root: A game of woodland Might and Right', but I hate spending literal
human lifetimes re-sizing the card so I can heap the nameless dead upon it
like some kind of 'Golden Books' take on 20th century atrocities!

Darn right, Jim! Not to mention how it forces you to count to three,
which I can't do anymore after I got brain damage from watching all those
crappy Youtube reaction videos.

ISN'T THERE AN EASIER WAY?!?!?!

Introducing the Koffin Keeper! A handy utility tool for 'Root: A game of woodland Might and Right.'
The Koffin Keeper helps you manage the effects of the "Coffin Makers" card
by holding your deceased meeples in one convenient location, and letting you
know how many points they'll be worth as an offering to your dark, sadistic gods!
When you're done, the Koffin Keeper closes up into a discreet package for
gallows humour on the go! Order yours today!

USAGE:
From the "games" menu, click the three-dots icon on this mod, and select "Additive load".
The object has both a "Closed" and "Open" state, which can be toggled by mousing over the
Coffin Keeper and pressing 1 or 2.
No longer needs to be locked, but you should lock it anyway!

You can use my project outside of Root, but I don't know why you would.
